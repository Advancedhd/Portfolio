        <p>For the Science Museum webiste i updated alot of the alt texts. The title on each page was wrong so i created unique titles for every page.
             I changed the font of the site to something that fits better with a science museum site.
             I updated it so that all the for="" labels had the correct input id's which earlier created bugs with my contact form and
             there was also some items that had div instead of form/ul and is now changed and working.
             I resized most of the pictures to a lower scale so they look alittlebit better. I created validation for the contact me page.
            The home menu icons is now in aligment with the rest of the menu items.</p><p>
            The booking form had some issues with it being not aligned, this is now fixed. There were also some issues with having some 
            things center aligned and some things left aligned, that is something i changed and it is all now center aligned
            The footer menu items were hard to hit on mobile screens and has now bigger spacing around them making them easier to hit.
            The museum site is the one i felt i improved on the most and is the one that needed the most improvement and is now better in terms of code and viewability.</p>
            <p>All these changes made the science museum page better in terms of functionality and appeal of the site. But there is still much to be done in terms of
                 the design and feel of what is supposed to be a science museum website.</p>
