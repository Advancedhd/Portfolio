        <h2>Over all year reflection</h2>
        <p>This year i have learned alot about programming and coding. The thing i need to improve the most is my 
            motivation towards doing what is needed to be done, i went into most of my tasks with a mindset of doing 
            50% of the work and in the end it made it alot harder for me. In terms of programming i still have tons of 
            improvement potential, both in design and technical perpectives.</p><p> Mostly i need to be better at design tho, 
            figuring out typography which colors works doesn't come to me naturally so its really easy to pick black on 
            white or the other way around. I do feel i have created alot of good things, and some things that just doesnt
             work the way i wanted it too.
            Like for the semester project i used maybe a week when i had 4 weeks to my disposal, 
            i'm leaving out so much potential to grow and improve. But it is what it is. For the project exam i used maybe 2 and a half weeks.
             Looking back it's sort of sad but atleast next time i might give it 100%</p>
