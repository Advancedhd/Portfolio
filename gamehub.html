        <p>To the gamehub page i decided to add a validation for the sign up process adjust some sizes, 
            this is the page i feel is the one that is the most finished form all my products so far, 
            and i struggled to figure out aspects of the site that needed upgrading, i tried to tweak
            the double click in order to add things to the cart, but i struggled alot and in the end 
            decided against it.
        </p>
        <p> The only thing thats terribly wrong on this site now is the grid on
            phone sizes, completely breaks the screen at the moment and i couldnt figure out what 
            aspect made it like that, i think when i fetched games from my wordpress API it somehow 
            broke it. And now i need to dig deep in order to find what's causing it so i priorized working on other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gamehub site is the website i made that has the most functionality in terms of javascript, however i need to get the 
            mobile screen sizing fixed and it was something i did not have time to fix for this project but i am aware that i 
            need to get that working, this shows that some tweaks in javascript can break alot of the design, however for bigger screensizes it's fine.
